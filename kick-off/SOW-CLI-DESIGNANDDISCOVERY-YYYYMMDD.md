# **Executive Summary**

**White Prompt, Inc** (hereafter “White Prompt”) is pleased to present this Statement of Work (hereafter “SOW”) to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, located at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (hereafter “CLIENT”). This statement of work contains the scope, plan, estimated effort, and estimated cost for designing the product and underlying architecture.

# **Scope of Work**

Under the terms of this SOW, **White Prompt** will work together with the CLIENT to execute the following tasks:

* Project KickOff: One short meeting to understand the needs in broad strokes.  
* Project Context: One long meeting to get a deeper understanding of the needs of the project and broad aspects of the project scope.  
* Brainstorming: Have some meetings to squeeze the understanding of the needs, looking forward to coming up with new creative ideas.  
* Competitor Analysis: Analyzing the competitors identified during the Project Context.  
* User Personas: Go through each identified actor of the scope and define them in detail.  
* Functional Discovery: Recurrent long meetings with the client to understand and document in depth the different functionalities of the application.  
* Flows & Wireframes: Create flows and wireframes to validate the correct definition of the functionality discovered.  
* User Testing: Design, conduct, and capture feedback from the users.  
* Object Model: Build the Object Model discovered in the Functional Discovery sessions.  
* Architecture: Design and document the Functional Scope and the Architecture discovered in the Functional Discovery Sessions. DevOps   
* DevOps Design: Estimate and  Plan the creation of the Project Infrastructure, CI, CD, Monitoring, Scalability, and Backup strategy.  
* Branding: Create different UI approaches for defining the Look and Feel and Logos.  
* Mockups: Design the Mockups (UI Designed pages) for the application.  
* Style Guide: Document the Style Guide and review with the Architecture team the technical aspects of it.  
* Estimation: Estimate the effort for building the platform and deliver a Plan

# **Design & Discovery  Phases**

## **Kick-Off**

This is the startup of the process. The whole team \- White Prompt and the CLIENT \- will review the plan, define the communication channel and schedule, and agree on how to monitor the progress of the Project.

## **Context**

This phase will require 1 or 2 online sessions to review every aspect of the existing/desired product. White Prompt will capture and document Epics, Actors,  and Project Goals during these sessions. 

Each session is an online desktop-sharing conference call that lasts \~3 hours. After each online session, White Prompt continues working, analyzing, and documenting the information captured. This information will be presented in the next session.

White Prompt will also research and analyze competitors to learn more about the field.

At the end of this Phase, White Prompt should clearly understand the project context, scope, and goals.

## **Discovery**

In this phase, White Prompt will conduct online sessions with The CLIENT to discover and document the functional scope that the project requires. These will be \~3-hour calls as well. White Prompt will focus on the User, discovering and documenting the **User Persona** and its interactions with the functionalities.

After each online session, White Prompt continues working, analyzing, and documenting the information captured. This information will be presented during the next session.

While capturing the information during these calls, White Prompt will create two main groups of assets: **Architecture** and **Wireframes**.

The Architecture will contain one or more **Architecture Diagrams** with the design of the solution. This includes all the components, the contracts between them, the technologies and third-party SAAS, and other **Architecture aspects** such as Scalability, High Availability, Security, Persistence, Auditability, and Observability.  
A **Technical Analysis** with one or more **Proof of Concepts** can be executed to determine if a technology is appropriate for the solution.

Together with the Architecture, an Object Model will be designed to represent the key concepts of the solution, the most important pieces of information, and the relationships between them. Initially, this model serves as a high-level, conceptual representation of the data structure. As the design progresses, this conceptual model will be refined and transformed into a concrete data solution, which may include specialized sub-models and leverage NoSQL databases where appropriate to optimize performance and scalability.

Every piece of Architecture documentation will be iterated and adjusted with the CLIENT.

While running the discovery, **Wireframes** will be built. A Wireframe is a quick sketch of the interface showing the data it contains and the actions the user can take. Wireframes also include annotations with the most important aspects of the functionality.

White Prompt will conduct online sessions with the CLIENT and other test users to “navigate” the Wireframes and validate them.

White Prompt will conduct Brainstorming meetings to develop new ideas that can improve the outcome of this process.

## **Branding**

White Prompt and the CLIENT will develop the application's Branding during this phase. This includes identifying or designing the logo, defining the pallet of colors, the fonts, spacings, icons, and good and bad use of the image. 

## **UI Design**

During this phase, White Prompt will work with the Client to define how to apply the Branding to the Wireframes. 

White Prompt will first gather visual requirements, create 3 approaches, and present them to the CLIENT for feedback. With the feedback collected, White Prompt will create a last graphic design approach for the CLIENT’s approval.

Once the Graphic Design approach has been approved, White Prompt will proceed to turn the Wireframes into graphic-designed mockups. 

Last, White Prompt will create a Style Guide that developers can use for implementing this and future applications.

## **Estimation**

With a clear definition of the scope and the proposed architecture, White Prompt will create a detailed list of tasks, estimate every single one in hours, and propose an execution plan to build it. 

The **Estimation** and **Plan** include the resources that should be allocated, the distribution in time of each task, a list of **Assumptions** used during the estimation, a list of **Risks** identified and how to mitigate them, a list of **Out-of-Scope** features, and a Budget.

## White Prompt and the CLIENT will review this estimation in detail to find room for improvement. 

# **Team and Plan**

To execute the above-mentioned phases, White Prompt will assign the following team.

* Technical Analyst (TA): A software architect with 15+ years of experience. The TA will be responsible for capturing and understanding the project functionality, creating the information diagrams, and assuring the technical viability.  
* UX Expert (UX): Defining the application flows and wireframes, and assuring the functional coherence of the project, defining the application look and feel, and designing the interfaces.   

These roles will work together as a team during different phases of the project to ensure its quality and feasibility.

Based on the Context, White Prompt estimates that the following plan should accomplish the goals of this project. It shows how many hours each role should dedicate to the project to execute the above-mentioned Project Design and Discovery Phases mentioned above.

The plan contemplates the dependency of the different tasks, distributing them in time to optimize resources and minimize the calendar duration of the project.
